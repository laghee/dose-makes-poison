# The Dose Makes the Poison
Exhausted and confused by the seemingly unending parade of quotidian substances labeled as toxic?

This simple Android application offers some perspective by comparing consumer ingredients based on their median lethal (ingested) dose on a scale of layperson-friendly reference points.

"All things are poison and nothing is without poison. Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison." 

- 16th century Renaissance physician and "Father of Toxicology," Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim), in his Third Defense

Although toxicity is complicated (as is the human body) and involves more than acute effects caused by short-term exposure, it is important to understand that dosage plays a crucial role in any evaluation of a potentially harmful material.

All chemicals—even water and oxygen and other "natural" substances—can be poisonous in sufficiently high levels. And, conversely, even substances generally considered harmful can have positive (or non-negative) effects in small, controlled doses—warfarin, for example, initially introduced as a pesticide against vermin is now used to treat blood clots in humans (and, in fact, is considered such a vital tool that it appears on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines for a health system).
