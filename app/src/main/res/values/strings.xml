    <string name="comparison_text">The lethal median dose for %1$s is %2$d mg/kg. That means
        %1$s is about as toxic as %3$s.</string>
    <string name="results_disclaimer">\n\nRemember: Quantity matters! The point of this comparison
        is to demonstrate that toxicity is relativeâ€”not absolute. The hope is to offer a
        beginner-friendly overview of a basic toxicology concept by referencing familiar elements,
        but these results are not meant to be advice or guidance. True toxicity analysis is very
        complicated.

    <string name="between_values">The lethal median dose for %1$s is %2$d mg/kg. That means
        %1$s is a bit more toxic than %3$s, but a bit less toxic than %4$s.</string>
